# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Game-Design

The purpose of the project was to work with the client, DriverPass, to build a system that provides driving studentsÂ with remote access to classes, practice tests, and scheduling in person training. The system is meant to be designed to include an LMS for the online learning classes, as well as the ability to schedule appointments for driver training. The system will need to verify user login and have different user "roles" that have various amounts of security access. The system will also need to be linked to the local DMVs in order to receive automatic updates on any new or changing rules, course content, and/ or practice questions. 

I think I did particularly well with providing clear diagrams. I would probably revise the assumptions and limitations part of the Business Requirements to add a few more that I believe I missed.

I interpreted the client, DriverPass, needs by listening to their interview and incorporating their requirements and desired functionalities. It is important to listen to the client's needs when designing a system because it is their product and they will be judging the work based off of the requirements they have provided. A system's success is based off of how well it fulfills the client's needs.

I came to the realization that a strong foundation is the most important part of the development process. This is done by doing very detailed requirement collection. This would provide the team with a clear end goal and development path. It will also give an understanding of what is expected from the system when it is completed.
